                        Rice is propagated directly from seed and sown on wet or dry seed beds or used to grow transplants in a nursery bed. Transplants produced in a nursery are always planted in dry seed beds when they are transferred to the field. Seeds may be sown in the field by broadcasting or by mechanical drilling. Three main methods are used for direct seeding rice in lowland areas: dry seedbeds, wet seedbeds and dapog. Dry seedbeds are prepared in close proximity to a water source. Each bed is generally 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in width and is seeded at a rate of 10 kg of seed for every 10 square meters. The seeds are covered with a light layer of soil and the bed is saturated with water until the seeds germinate. Wet seedbeds are raised nursery beds in which pre-germinated seeds are sown. The bed is puddled or wet with water and the germinated seeds are spread out uniformly and kept wet. When the seedling reach 2-3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) in height, shallow irrigation is used and the water levels in the bed are increased as the plants grow. Dapod is a method of producing transplants on a mat made of banana leaves of plastic sheeting which is used in some areas of the Philippines. Pre-germinated seeds are spread out on cement of wet soil and covered with the leaves or plastic sheeting. The cover is pushed down onto the seeds and continuously watered. After 11 days, the mat is rolled up and transferred to to the field. 
Rice can be harvested using the traditional method of cutting by hand. Rice should be cut when 80–85% of the panicles have turned from green to straw colored. When harvested by hand, the rice is cut using sharp knives or sickles. Rice can be  mechanically harvested using threshers or combines.

                        Rice is mainly grown in warmer regions as the plants will not grow at temperatures below 10°C. Rice is considered to be a semi-aquatic annual grass and is commonly grown in paddies in wetlands or under shallow water.Heavy solis for example clay or clay loam are well suited to the rice as they have very good water holding capacity.

                          Planting Wheat varieties should be planted in the Fall approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the first frost date. Wheat should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring. Commercially grown wheat is usually mechanically drilled using a machine that creates a furrow and drops the seed in before covering it back up. 
                          Wheat seeds can be sown by hand broadcasting in smaller areas, or using a hand-cranked seeder. Seeds are usually sown to at depths ranging from 2 to 12 cm (0.8–4.7 in) depending on soil conditions (seed must be sown deeper in drier soil). Once the seeds have been scattered, the soil should be raked lightly to set the seeds at the desired depth.
                          Harvesting Wheat is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground. Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest. The should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture. Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine. Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle. Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors.

                            Maize can be propagated directly from seed.Planting dates for maize depend on the variety being grown. Standard varieties should be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 12.7°C (55°F) and supersweet varieties when the soil reaches 18.3°C (65°F). Soil can be brought up to temperature faster by laying black plastic mulches approximately 1 week prior to planting. Seeds should be sown about 2.5 cm (1 in) deep and 10–15 cm (~3–4 in) apart allowing 76–91 cm (~30–36 in) between rows. Maize should be planted in blocks (numerous rows) rather than in a single long row as it is wind pollinated and pollen can transfer between plants much more efficiently. Seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing 20–30 cm (8–12 in) when they are approximately 7.5–10.0 cm (3–4 in) in height. It is common to stagger maize plantings to ensure a continuous harvest over the summer months.
                            Each maize stalk should produce 1 large ear of maize. Under ideal conditions, the stalk will produce a second, slightly smaller ear which reaches maturity slightly later than the first. Maize ears should be harvested at the “milk stage” of development, when the kernels within the husk are well packed and produce a milky substance when the kernel is punctured. Check ears for ripeness by gently peeling back a small portion of the husk. Be sure to check the ears frequently for ripeness and harvest as required as ears can quickly become over-ripe and lose their sweetness. Remove the ears from the stalk by pulling quickly downward while twisting and then refrigerate until consumption.

                            Maize is best grown in warm, tropical and sub-tropical regions and clay loamy regions as it requires warm soils to develop optimally. One of the most important requirements for growing maize is a high quality soil which is deep, fertile and well-draining with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Maize plants are very heavy feeders and even the most fertile of soils may need to supplemented with nutrients as the plants develop, particularly nitrogen. Maize also requires plenty of space as it grows and is pollinated by wind. It should be planted where it will receive full sunlight for most of the day and provided with ample moisture.                          </div>

                            Symptoms are usually first apparent at the tasseling stage; plant stalks become shredded and pith is completely rotted with stringy strands of vascular tissue left intact; small, black fungal fruiting bodies are visible in the vascular strands and give the tissue a gray coloration; fungus grows into internodes of the stalk causing the plant to ripen early and causing the stalk to weaken; plant may break.

                            Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves; pustules rupture and release powdery red spores; pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores; if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow; in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore.
                            <br>Bacterial Stalk Rot : <br>
                            Plants suddenly beginning to lodge (bend to lie along the ground) midway through season; one or more internodes above soil line turning brown, water-soaked, soft and slimy; tissue has foul odor and mushy appearance;

                              Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient for corn. An estimate of N requirements for corn is 1 lb of N is needed for every bushel of grain produced, so a 200 bu corn crop would require 200 lb of N. A relatively new concept in N application rates is referred to as maximum return to N.                            </div>

                              Grow available resistant varieties. Use certified healthy seeds. Remove the crop debris and burn them. Use suitable insecticide to control flea beetle. Plow all crop debris into soil in Fall; plant corn in well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged plants.Avoid stressing plants by practicing good water management.Rotate crops with small grains may help reduce disease incidence.
                              The most effective method of controlling diseases is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf.

                              Jowar is propagated directly from seed. Seed should only be sown in soils which have warmed to at least 18.3°C (65°F). Ideally, seeds should be sown in a finely prepared seed bed but seeds are often sown in furrows following plowing or broadcast. A wide range of row spacings are used successfully in Jowar cultivation with the final spacings being dependent of climatic conditions and available moisture. Under favorable conditions for sorghum growth, plants should be spaced 12–20 cm (4.7–7.9 in) apart, allowing 45–60 cm (17.7–23.6 in) between rows. This spacing produced an optimal planting density of approximately 120,000 plants per hectare.
                              Jowar can be harvested by hand or by combine. When harvesting by hand, the heads or whole plants may be cut.Jowar should be harvested when the grain moisture content is between 18 and 23% and may be ready for harvest when the leaves are still green. After harvest, grains are removed from the heads by threshing.

                            Jowar is a warm-season grass which is adapted to grow in a wide range of soil types and climatic conditions, tolerating waterlogging and poor soils. It will perform optimally when planted in deep, fertile and well draining loam soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Jowar is best grown in hot tropical or semi tropical environments i.e., sandy loam but it will tolerate a range of temperatures. The crop tolerates hot, dry conditions better than corn or soybeans but it will be killed by frost. Soil temperatures of at least 18.3°C (65°F) are required for germination.

                                The cost of planting grain sorghum is much less expensive than other crops, primarily because of seed price. As a result, many growers assume they can save on other input costs as well. The best example of this involves the use of fertilizer. On a per bushel basis, grain sorghum requires a similar amount of most nutrients as corn. If a grower wants to produce a 100-bushel sorghum crop, the grower must support this yield goal with a supply of adequate nutrients, including phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfur and potassium.                       </div>

                              Cotton is propagated from seed by planting directly in a prepared field when growing conditions are favorable (suitable temperature, adequate rainfall etc). Cotton should only be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 18.3°C (65°F). Generally, seeds should be sown at a depth of 0.25 cm (1 in), with 3–6 seed sown in each hole. Ridging the soil is recommended as it helps to drain the plant in wet conditions and also to conserve water in dry conditions. Plant spacing depends on the variety but generally 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in) should be left between plants. 
                              Cotton is still picked by hand in many areas of the world where the crop is grown. In the US cotton is machine harvested. Cotton in ready to harvest approximately 4 months after sowing when the bolls split open to reveal the white cotton fibers. Fields are usually picked once every 3 to 4 weeks to prevent the fibers remaining in the field too long where they are susceptible to pests. The entire field is usually harvested with 2 to 3 pickings.

The seeds will germinate optimally at 34°C (93.2°F), while the seedlings requires a temperature between 24 and 29°C (75.2–84.2°F) to grow and develop properly. Cotton will grow on a variety of soils including sandy soil and heavy clay as long as it is water permeable and will grow optimally in a soil with a pH of 5.5–8.5. In addition cotton has a high tolerance for salt.

                                Boron aids in efficient utilization of other nutrients including nitrogen and potassium, and can help move nitrogen and carbohydrates from leaves to developing fruit. It in turn helps assimilate these into complex carbohydrates and proteins, making cotton fiber. Boron is critical for the uptake of calcium (Ca) and helping improve Ca movement through the plant. When high levels of Ca are being applied, additional boron may be needed to maximize Ca uptake.

                                  Plants stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency and other pests are more susceptible to the disease; fungus spreads rapidly in dense canopies, especially during periods of warm, wet weather. The use of resistant cotton varieties is the most effective method of controlling the disease; cultural practices such as plowing crop residue into soil after harvest can also limit disease emergence.                       </div>

                                Sugarcane is vegetatively propagated by planting part of a mature cane called “setts”. Setts should be cut from carefully selected mature canes. A few days before the cuttings are taken, the end of the canes are removed to break the apical dominance of the cane and promote the breaking of buds. The best cuttings are taken from the upper portions of the cane and should be approximately 40 cm (16 in) in length with 2–3 buds. Sugarcane setts should be planted horizontally or at a 45° angle in furrows 15–30 cm (6–12 in) deep. Once in the ground, the setts should be covered with a thin layer of soil. Setts can be grown in a nursery bed and transplanted to the field or planted directly at the final growing site. The average planting density for sugarcane is 15,000–24,000 cuttings per hectare of land. Normally furrow method of planting is followed. A new method called pit method of planting promises two to three times more yield and more ratoon (up to 10) compared to furrow method. 
                                Sugarcane is most commonly harvested by hand cutting Stalks should be cut close to the ground with a sharp knife when the canes are fully mature.

                                 Sugarcane grows best in tropical and subtropical regions as the plants require a warm, sunny and moist environment for growth. Red volconic and Alluvial soils of rivers are suitable to grow Sugarcane.Plants will grow optimally at temperatures between 26 and 33°C (78.8–91.4°F) where there are no frosts which will damage the plants. Sugarcane can be grown successfully in a variety of soils but will perform optimally in deep, well-draining soils, rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.0 and 8.0. Sugarcane requires an average annual rainfall of between 1800 and 2500 mm per year for adequate growth. If rainfall is too low, plants should be grown with irrigation to maximize yield.

                                   Nitrogen is considered to be the most important nutrient, and plants absorb more nitrogen than any other element. Nitrogen is essential to in making sugarcane plants are healthy as they develop and nutritious to eat after they’re harvested. That’s because nitrogen is essential in the formation of protein, and protein makes up much of the tissues of most living things.
                                    Phosphate, is linked to a Sugarcane ability to use and store energy, including the process of photosynthesis. It’s also needed to help Sugarcane grow and develop normally.

                                    Mustards is propagated from seed and due to the small size of the seeds, should be planted in a well prepared seed bed which is firm and flat. Mustard seeds should be sown in Spring once soils have warmed to 4.4–7.2°C (40–45°F) and should be planted at a depth of 1.25–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) at a density of 8–14 lbs of seeds per acre. The seed can be spread by broadcasting in the home garden or, in the case of commercial production, using a seed drill. Mustard generally matures in 80–85 days. 
                                    The best method of preventing weed growth in a mustard field is to plant seeds at the appropriate depth. Shallow planted seeds germinate rapidly, allowing the development of a uniform plant stand. Established plants are less susceptible to competition from weeds. soil should be tested to determine nutrient requirements prior to planting. Mustard will benefit from the addition of supplemental nitrogen and this is generally applied at a rate of 100–120 lb per acre.
                                    Mustard is generally ready to harvest 80 to 85 days after planting. The crop should be harvested promptly to reduce losses to shattering. In commercially grown fields the recommended method of harvest is swathing. The plants should be cut just below the height of the lowest seed pods. In the home garden, mustard can be harvested by hand by cutting the plants. The seeds can then be recovered from the pods and dried for storage.

                                      Nitrogen (N) is essential for vigorous growth, high yield and quality of mustard. Nitrogen is essential in the production of plant proteins and chlorophyll, and is needed in the greatest amount compared to the other macronutrients. Nitrogen uptake and utilization takes place throughout the entire growth cycle. When plants are deficient in N they will have pale green to yellow foliage and the plants will often be spindly. Yellowing of the older leaves is another indication that the mustard may be deficient in N. Nitrogen is distributed from old leaves to younger leaves in the plant resulting in deficiency symptoms first appearing on older leaves. On a canopy level, when a crop is N deficient, the canopy will likely be thin and open and the flowering period will be shortened leading to reduced pod set and lower yield. </div>

                                      Rotate crops; plant only disease-free seed; apply appropriate fungicide if disease becomes a problem. Primary method of controlling diseases is through the use of good sanitation practices; rotate crops to non-cruciferous crops every 2 years; plant resistant varieties; control cruciferous weed species which may act as a reservoir for bacteria; plant pathogen-free seed.</div>

                                   Groundnut is usually propagated from seed. Seeds should be planted in a well prepared seedbed in soil that is loose and crumbly with no large clumps. The seedbed should be free from weeds which will compete with the groundnut seedlings. Weeds may be removed by hand cultivating or through the use of an appropriate herbicide. Groundnut seeds should be planted by hand to a depth of 3–5 cm (1–2 in). It is best to ridge the soil or use flat beds as this will make harvesting the peanuts easier. Groundnuts can be grown a sole crop or intercropped with other crops such as corn (maize), cassava or soybean.
                                   Groundnuts are ready for harvest between 85 and 130 days after sowing, depending on the variety. Pods can be harvested by hand or by mechanical means. Plants should be pulled from the ground and the pods removed. After harvest, pods are dried in the sun for 2–10 days until their moisture content is about 10%.

                                      Groundnuts grow very well sandy or clay loam soil, requiring warm temperatures and a long growing season. Plants grow optimally at a temperatures between 30 and 34°C (86–93°F) although they will tolerate a range between 15 and 45°C (59–113°F). Temperatures above 34°C may damage flowers. The groundnut plant grows best in a light, well draining sandy loam, but may also grow in heavier soils. The optimal pH range for peanut growth is with a pH of 6.0-6.5. Groundnuts are resistant to drought and can withstand long periods without water albeit with a reduction in yield. For optimal production, a well distributed rainfall of between 500 and 600 mm of water over the course of the growing season is ideal.

                                        Avoiding frost damage by planting early peanut varieties can help protect the plant from fungal colonization; application of appropriate foliar fungicides (e.g. benomyl). Plant seeds which are coated with protectants; avoid injuring plants with tools and/or machinery; application of appropriate fungicides can reduce crop losses when disease is present; avoid excessive irrigation during cool weather.

                                      Red Gram is propagated directly from seed which should be sown in a prepared seed bed. Seeds should be planted to a depth of 2.5–10 cm (1–4 in) leaving 30–50 cm (12–20) between plants and 150 cm (60 in) between rows. Higher seeding rates should be used if the pant is being grown for use as a green manure. Red Gram is commonly intercropped with millets, cotton, sorghum or groundnut.
                                      Red Gram is commonly harvested by hand. Machine harvesting by combine is possible if a variety is grown where pods ripen uniformly.
                                      The plant is cut at the ground when the majority of pods have reached maturity. The plants are air dried and then threshed to remove the seeds.

The plants  can also be grown in a wide range of soils, from sandy soil to clay and also in soils with low fertility. Red Gram will grow optimally in a well drained soil with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0. Once established, Red Gram is relatively tolerant to drought conditions and can survive for long periods with little irrigation.

                                      Soybean is propagated directly from seed. If seeds are to planted in a field where soybean has not been been grown in the 3–5 year previous, they should first be inoculated with nitrogen fixing bacteria. The seedbed should be prepared prior to planting by removing any crop residue, weeds and large stones. Tilling the soil helps to break up large clods of earth. Seeds may be sown mechanically or by hand. in tilled soils, seeds are usually planted at a depth 3.2–4.5 cm (1.25 to 1.75 in) in rows spaced 30 cm (11.8 in) apart. Alternatively, no-till planting may be used to plant seeds in the stubble of a previous crop without first cultivating the soil. With this method, seeds are drilled into the soil in rows spaced 17.8 cm (7 in) apart. No-till practices reduce soil erosion and reduces the loss of moisture in the soil.
                                      Soybeans are ready to harvest between 70 and 160 days after planting, depending on variety. Plants are ready for harvest when the leaves and stems have turned yellow and the seed pods brown to black. Soybeans for fresh use are cut while still green. Plants may be pulled by hand or cut with the use of a combine. Once cut, the seeds are removed from the pods by threshing.

                                          Soybean is a short-day plant, requiring hot weather for optimum production. It can be grown year round in most parts of the tropics. Plants can be grown at ambient temperatures between 15 and 27°C (60–80°F) although temperature below 21°C (69.8°F) and above 32 (89.6°F) may reduce flowering. Temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) are detrimental to seed production. Soybeans are adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and climates but require adequate soil moisture for germination and seedling establishment. Plants are sensitive to waterlogging but are tolerant of drought conditions once established. Soybean grows best on a light, loose, well draining loam with a pH of 6.5.

                                          First appear as small, pale green to yellow circular spots on the leaves during late vegetative or early reproductive growth stages. As the disease progresses, the areas between the leaf veins will first turn bright yellow, then eventually brown, with the veins remaining green. The brown tissue between veins may die and fall out, leaving large ragged holes and streaks in leaves. The leaves will detach from the petioles and fall to the ground. The petioles remain attached, giving the plant a somewhat skeletal appearance. Symptoms are generally more pronounced in the upper canopy. Flowers and pods may abort or not fill.
                  
                                         <br> Phytophthora :  <br>
                                         Phytophthora sojae can infect soybeans at any growth stage from seed to maturity. Early season symptoms include seed rot and pre- and post emergence damping off. The most characteristic symptom of Phytophthora root rot is a dark brown lesion on the lower stem that extends up from the taproot of the plant. The lesion often reaches as high as several nodes and will girdle soybean stems, restricting flow of nutrients and water, and stunting or killing the plant.

                                          Soybeans do not require high fertilizer application rates, yet, an accurate nutritional plan is necessary for increasing yields.
                                           The crop classified as moderately sensitive to saline, with a salinity threshold of 2.0 dS/m. Soil pH of 6 – 6.8 is ideal.
                                           Soybeans grains have a nitrogen content of 40%, therefore an adequate fertilization of nitrogen is a key factor in achieving high quality yields.</div>

                                            The key in most areas is planting soybean varieties with the highest level of SDS resistance. Varieties should also be resistant to SCN, and crops should be rotated to manage SCN populations. Other tactics include reducing excessive soil moisture with drainage, minimizing compaction, and staggering planting dates.
                                            Management of Phytophthora root rot involves the use of resistant rootstocks, irrigation management, fungicides, and fumigation. When replanting or establishing new plantings, choose resistant rootstocks where possible, but also consider tolerance to other diseases, nematodes, and cold. The most tolerant rootstocks are trifoliate orange, swingle citrumelo, citrange, Alemow, and sour orange.
                                            Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae.                                                                  </div>

                                            The Sesame plant (Sesamum indicum) is grown for its seeds. Commercial sesame production is largely for producing oil from the seeds. It is used in a variety of products, including soaps and pharmaceuticals. For the home gardener, this can be a fun plant to grow for the seeds and cooking. You can grow sesame seeds easily too, as long as you have the right climate for it. Sesame plants thrive in hot, dry weather. It is not hardy at all and will slow its growth or even stop growing at temperatures below 68 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 10 Celsius). Sesame is extremely drought tolerant, but still needs water and will produce more seeds if irrigated.

                                              The sesame crop is grown as summer crop, kharif crop and also  known as semi-rabi crop. Sesame thrives well on soils with neutral reaction or slightly acidic type. There should not be any water stagnation in the soil, so make sure soil is well drained and light loamy soil for better growth performance. The preferred soil pH range of sesame crop is 5.5 to 8.0. Saline soils or too much sandy soils are not suitable for sesame cultivation. Adding well rotten farm yard manure to the soil is beneficial in getting higher yields.

The disease, which affects leaves as early as 4 weeks after planting, starts as small pin head sized cottony spots on the infected leaves. These spots gradually spread on the lamina and can extend up to 4 mm in diameter.

                                                Phosphorus is very important in the early vegetative growth stages. Phosphorus promotes strong early plant growth and development of a strong root system. Potassium fertilization increases yields. Sesame will require approximately 40 to 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre on irrigated production and 25 to 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre on dry land production.                       </div>

                                                  The infected and dried leaves should be collected and burnt in order to reduce the inoculum source in the field.Spraying Blitox or Blue copper at 3 g/l of water was found effective against leaf spot.	Crop rotations should be followed whenever possible.

                                                  Jute is propagated by seed. The seed typically requires scarification to begin germination or seeds may be soaked in boiling water for ten seconds, then planted into raised beds 1 m. wide. If the plant is to be harvested by uprooting, seeds should be planted with a 30-50 cm row spacing. If leaves will be harvested by pruning, seedlings that have reached a height of 10 cm should be transplanted into rows and spaced 30-50 cm apart. Cow dung, wood ashes, rotted water hyacinth or its ashes may be used to enrich the soil. Leaf production improves with increases in water availability. Under cultivation, Jute is grown as an annual, though it may act as a perennial in some locations. It can be planted at the beginning of the rainy season and will withstand the hot, humid months. It can also withstand some drought conditions. Leaves and young shoots can be pruned from the plant as they emerge and are most desirable when young. Growth will continue and edible portions can be harvested continuously. Plants may also be uprooted and leaves removed from the stem for cooking. Fruit should be harvested when immature and tender. Jute is typically self-pollinating, though some out-crossing is possible. An isolation distance of 15 m between cultivars is recommended for seed production. Fruits should be allowed to dry on the stock, usually for 6 weeks after flowering. Dried pods can be beaten or threshed to release seeds.

                                                  River basins or alluvial or loamy soils are best for jute cultivation. Jute cultivation in red soils may require high dose of manure and pH range between 4.8 and 5.8 is best for its cultivation. Plain land or gentle slope or low land is ideal for jute cultivation.
